# RtMidi

This is my fork of RtMidi - I have modified the CMakeLists.txt to build a shared library on a Raspberry Pi with ALSA support.

# Do Not use this fork!!!!!
   
instead go to to original at,  
https://github.com/thestk/rtmidi  
  
# Building  
  Start at the Raspbery Pi Home directory,
  /Home/pi
  
  Clone the code,
  git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/YOUR-REPOSITORY

  CD to the directory,
  CD rtmidi

  Make a build directory,
  mkdir build

  Run the rebuild.sh script.
  RtMidi will be built as a shared library and instanlles properly on the pi.
